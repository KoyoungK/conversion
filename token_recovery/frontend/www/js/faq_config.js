	{
		question : "Who is eligible for the eosDAC token recovery process?",
		answer : "This process is made for people who have eosDAC (erc20) that sits in an unregistered wallet without EOS fallback key (genesis). You need to own the private key of your ethereum address AND have an active EOS accountname. If your eosDAC is locked in an exchange or smart contract, we are not able to recover it."
	}

	,{
		question : "How does the eosDAC token recovery process work?",
		answer : "Your EOS accountname will be sent to our 'Proof Of Ownership' smart contract. This way we can be 100% sure that you own the ethereum address that holds eosDAC. Be aware that your ethereum account needs to have a positive ETH balance because you'll need to pay a small gas fee to interact with the contract."
	}

	,{
		question : "When will I receive my eosDAC on the EOS main net?",
		answer : "You will not receive your eosDAC immediatly. We will read the entries from the smart contract periodically. deadline"
	}
	,{
		question : "Can I interact with the smart contract via MEW?",
		answer : "Yes, you don't have to use this GUI to interact with the smart contract. You can use MEW or remix too. see tutorial-link"
	}
	,{
		question : "I registered the wrong accountname, can I still change it?",
		answer : "Yes, you are able to change the accountname on which you want to receive eosDAC. Deadline date xxxx. Just redo the process with the correct accountname. The smart contract will overwrite the old data."
